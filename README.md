# 🏡 Edmonton Property Pricing Analysis (Capstone Project)

This capstone project analyzes over *300,000 residential transactions* in Edmonton to determine how property features—like bathrooms, garages, and crime rates—influence home prices. We used segmented analysis, advanced machine learning, and geospatial integration to build a high-performance predictive model.

## 📌 Key Highlights

•⁠  ⁠Integrated *property, crime, and neighborhood metadata* into a unified dataset
•⁠  ⁠Applied *Random Forest & XGBoost* models (R² ≈ 0.92)
•⁠  ⁠Used *SHAP values* for model interpretability
•⁠  ⁠Built interactive *Tableau dashboard* for insights
•⁠  ⁠Compared Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Networks
